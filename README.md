#Amsthrees

Story
Amsthress is the free adaptation of the mobile platforms game “Threes”. 
The main goal of the game is to slide cards in a grid to combine them to create the highest multiple of three possible.
How high will you get??

How to load
Tape:Press CTRL and small ENTER and press PLAY in the tape. Alternatively type RUN”, then ENTER, and follow the instructions on the screen.
 
Disk:Type ‘Run”Loader’


How to Play
Use your controls to slide the 4x4 grid in the four main directions (up,down,left and right). All the cards in the grid will move accordingly, combining with each other when no movement to a free slot is possible.
The cards that may combine keeps the following schema:
1 + 2 = 3
3 + 3 = 6
6 + 6 = 12
12+12 = 24
...
And so on.

After no more moves left, the game ends, showing the score for every card higher than 2 that is on the grid. The higher the card is, the higher the score.


Controls
The game can be handled with a joystick plugged into the first joystick slot, or by the keyboard.
The user can redefine the keys in the main screen. And the default keys are:

Up, Down, Left, Right : Arrow keys.
Fire: “Space”
Music ON/OFF: “M”
Pause: “DEL”
Abort: “ESC”
